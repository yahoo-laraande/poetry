Once upon a midnight dreary as I pondered weak and weary
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore

Ah distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
Eagerly I wished the morrow—vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore
From that rare and raidiant maiden whom the angels named Lenore
Nameless here forevermore

And the silky sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
